        <p class="story">&emsp;For many locals in the Chesapeake Bay area, PINES OF NOWHERE is a name that has long been synonymous with terrific home-style cooking. In fact, PINES OF NOWHERE first opened in May 1980 when Jane Doe and her son, John Doe, had an idea about serving up real home-style cooking. Together they would do it all from cooking to serving to bussing and cleaning up. Mother and son built a restaurant that soon became a favorite spot for many, serving friendly fare.</p>
